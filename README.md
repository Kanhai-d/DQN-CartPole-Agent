# DQN-CartPole-Agent
This project showcases a deep reinforcement learning agent built with PyTorch to solve the classic CartPole-v1 environment. The agent, a Deep Q-Network (DQN), learns to balance a pole on a cart using a combination of a replay buffer and an epsilon-greedy policy for stable and effective learning.
